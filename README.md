## üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### Pipeline Triggers
The automated CI/CD pipeline runs on:
- **Push to main/master branch**
- **Pull requests to main/master branch**

### Pipeline Jobs

#### 1. Frontend Build and Test Job
- **Environment**: Ubuntu latest with Node.js 20
- **Dependencies**: Automated installation with npm caching
- **Code Quality**: ESLint linting and TypeScript compilation
- **Testing**: Vitest test suite with coverage reporting
- **Build**: Production asset compilation
- **Artifacts**: Build files uploaded for deployment

#### 2. Docker Build and Push Job
- **Multi-platform Builds**: AMD64 and ARM64 architectures
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Image Tagging**: Branch name, commit SHA, and 'latest'
- **Build Optimization**: Docker layer caching for faster builds
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### Pipeline Features
- **Parallel Job Execution** for faster builds
- **Dependency Caching** for improved performance
- **Automated Testing** with coverage reports
- **Multi-platform Docker Images** for broad compatibility
- **Container Registry Integration** for image distribution

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Framework
- **Test Runner**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Coverage Provider**: V8 for accurate coverage reporting
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, component tests, and integration tests

### Quality Checks
- **ESLint**: Code linting and style enforcement
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting
- **Build Validation**: Production build verification

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:ci

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ÔøΩ Environment Configuration

### API Configuration
Configure the backend API URL using environment variables:

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your backend URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

# Task Management Frontend - CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation for a React-based Task Management Frontend application using GitHub Actions and Docker containerization.

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project showcases modern DevOps practices including:
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- **Docker Containerization** for consistent deployments
- **Multi-platform Image Builds** (AMD64/ARM64)
- **Container Registry Integration** with GitHub Container Registry
- **Automated Testing** and code quality checks
- **Production-ready Deployment** strategies

## üìã Application Overview

**Task Management Frontend** - A React-based web application that provides:
- Task creation and management interface
- Search and filter functionality
- Task execution capabilities
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- API integration for backend communication

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Development**: Docker Compose

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

The application includes comprehensive Docker support for both development and production environments:

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
docker-compose up --build frontend-dev
# Access: http://localhost:5173
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Start production server with Nginx
docker-compose --profile production up --build frontend-prod
# Access: http://localhost:80
```

### Docker Features
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized production images
- **Hot reload** support for development
- **Volume mounting** for live code changes
- **Multi-platform support** (AMD64/ARM64)
- **Nginx optimization** for production serving

## üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### Pipeline Triggers
The automated CI/CD pipeline runs on:
- **Push to main/master branch**
- **Pull requests to main/master branch**

### Pipeline Jobs

#### 1. Frontend Build and Test Job
- **Environment**: Ubuntu latest with Node.js 20
- **Dependencies**: Automated installation with npm caching
- **Code Quality**: ESLint linting and TypeScript compilation
- **Testing**: Vitest test suite with coverage reporting
- **Build**: Production asset compilation
- **Artifacts**: Build files uploaded for deployment

#### 2. Docker Build and Push Job
- **Multi-platform Builds**: AMD64 and ARM64 architectures
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Image Tagging**: Branch name, commit SHA, and 'latest'
- **Build Optimization**: Docker layer caching for faster builds
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### Pipeline Features
- **Parallel Job Execution** for faster builds
- **Dependency Caching** for improved performance
- **Automated Testing** with coverage reports
- **Multi-platform Docker Images** for broad compatibility
- **Container Registry Integration** for image distribution

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Framework

npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ÔøΩ Environment Configuration

### API Configuration
Configure the backend API URL using environment variables:

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your backend URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
